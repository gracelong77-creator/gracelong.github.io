Hi! I’m Grace Long, a Geography & Environmental Studies student at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS), where I research sustainable land use, game ranching, and savanna ecosystems. 

My honors thesis explores bush encroachment, vegetation palatability, and rangeland health in semi-arid South African landscapes using GIS, remote sensing, and field data. I’m particularly interested in how different land-use practices, like game ranching and livestock grazing, shape ecological and social sustainability.

Beyond my research, I work as a Teaching and Learning Assistant in the GES Department, where I support courses in remote sensing and quantitative analysis. I’m passionate about using geography to tell environmental stories—translating spatial data into narratives that highlight how people and ecosystems interact.

You can learn more about my ongoing projects on the ... page, or view my [CV](/cv/) for a full overview of my work and academic experience.
